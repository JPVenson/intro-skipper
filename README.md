</div>

Analyzes the audio of television episodes to detect and skip over intros.

This fork doesn't ship the custom web interface on your server. So the plugin needs to be configured to automatically skip intros.

## System requirements

* Jellyfin 10.8.4 (or newer)
* Jellyfin's [fork](https://github.com/jellyfin/jellyfin-ffmpeg) of `ffmpeg` must be installed, version `5.0.1-5` or newer
  * `jellyfin/jellyfin` 10.8.z container: preinstalled
  * `linuxserver/jellyfin` 10.8.z container: preinstalled
  * Debian Linux based native installs: provided by the `jellyfin-ffmpeg5` package
  * MacOS native installs: build ffmpeg with chromaprint support ([instructions](#installation-instructions-for-macos))

## Introduction parameters

Show introductions will be detected if they are:

* Located within the first 25% of an episode or the first 10 minutes, whichever is smaller
* Between 15 seconds and 2 minutes long

Ending credits will be detected if they are shorter than 4 minutes.

All of these requirements can be customized as needed.
